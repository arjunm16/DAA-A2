    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The minimum st-cut of a network flow graph is a cut that separates the source node s and the sink node t such that the sum of the capacities of the edges crossing the cut is minimized. This cut represents the minimum amount of capacity that needs to be removed from the network to disconnect s and t.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The Ford_Fulkerson algorithm is used to find the minimum st-cut of a network flow graph. It is based on the idea of finding an augmenting path from s to t, which is a path in the residual graph (a graph that represents the remaining capacity of the edges after sending flow through the graph) with positive capacity. The algorithm then increases the flow along the path, updating the residual graph accordingly, until no augmenting path exists.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To find the minimum st-cut, we can run the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and compute the residual graph at the point when no augmenting path exists. We can then perform a breadth-first search from the source node s in the residual graph to identify all nodes that can be reached from s. The minimum st-cut is the set of edges that have one endpoint in the set of reachable nodes and the other endpoint in the set of unreachable nodes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The time complexity of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for the minimum s-t cut problem is O(VE^2), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph.</li>
            <br>
            <li>This algorithm is dual to the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and hence the previous results follow.</li>
        </ul>
