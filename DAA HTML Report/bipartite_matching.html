        <ul>
            <li>Bipartite matching is a special case of the maximum flow problem where the graph is bipartite, meaning that the nodes can be partitioned into two sets such that there are no edges between nodes in the same set. The goal is to find a matching, which is a set of edges that do not share any common endpoints, such that the number of matched nodes is maximized.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm can be used to solve the bipartite matching problem by transforming the bipartite graph into a network flow graph. This is done by adding a source node s connected to one set of nodes (the "left" set) and a sink node t connected to the other set of nodes (the "right" set). Each edge between a node in the left set and a node in the right set is given a capacity of 1, representing the fact that each edge can be used to match at most one node.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm can then be applied to find the maximum flow from s to t, which represents the maximum number of nodes that can be matched. The set of matched nodes can be found by performing a depth-first search or a breadth-first search on the residual graph starting from s, looking for edges that are part of a path from s to t and that have a flow of 1. The set of nodes connected by these edges represents a maximum matching.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>The time complexity of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for the bipartite matching problem is O(VE^2), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph.</li>

        <center><h3>Analysis of Results</h3></center>
        <ul>
        <li>The code implementation was run on several test cases , for upto 8096 total vertices.</li>
        <li>It can be seen that as the total number of vertices increase, the time increases non-linearly.</li>
        <li>The curve observed is similar to a quadratic curve, or a cubic curve as shown.</li>
        <li>It is important to note that this worst-case time complexity is not always reached in practice, and the actual running time may be much faster depending on the specific structure of the graph and the implementation of the algorithm.</li>
